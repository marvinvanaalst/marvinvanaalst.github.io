	<p>
		MxlPy (pronounced "em axe el pie") is a Python package for mechanistic learning (Mxl) - the
		combination of mechanistic modeling and machine learning to deliver explainable, data-informed
		solutions.

	<p>
		modelbase is a python package to help you build and analyze dynamic mathematical models of
		biological systems. It has originally been designed for the simulation of metabolic systems, but
		can be used for virtually any processes, in which some substances get converted into others.

<SoftwareCard title="moped" gitlab="https://gitlab.com/qtb-hhu/moped" doi="10.3390/metabo12040275">
	<p>
		moped serves as an integrative hub for reproducible construction, modification, curation and
		analysis of metabolic models. moped supports draft reconstruction of models directly from
		genome/proteome sequences and pathway/genome databases utilizing GPR annotations, providing a
		completely reproducible model construction and curation process

<SoftwareCard title="dismo" gitlab="https://gitlab.com/qtb-hhu/dismo">
	<p>
		dismo is a Python package for building and analysing discrete spatial models based on ordinary
		differential equations. Its primary purpose is to allow arbitrarily complex internal and
		transport processes to easily be mapped over multiple different regular grids. For this it
		features one, two and three-dimensional layouts, with standard and non-standard (e.g. hexagonal
		or triangular) grids.

<SoftwareCard title="COBREXA.jl" github="https://github.com/COBREXA/COBREXA.jl">
	<p>
		Cobrexa is a Julia package for scalable, high-performance constraint-based reconstruction and
		analysis of very large-scale biological models. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the
		integration of modern high performance computing environments with the processing and analysis
		of large-scale metabolic models of challenging complexity. We report the architecture of the
		package, and demonstrate how the design promotes analysis scalability on several use-cases with
		multi-organism community models.
