<p>Hello there ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>
	I'm a postdoc working as a research software engineer at the <a
		href="https://www.cpbl.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/sazuq/?lidx=1">Computational Life Science lab</a
	>
	at <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de">RWTH Aachen</a>. I enjoy writing
	<a href="/software">software</a>
	to make it easier to work with mathematical / theoretical biology. Of course I also still actively
	<a href="/papers">do research</a>.
</p>

<h2>Quick CV</h2>
<p>
	I studied Biology and Quantitative Biology at <a href="https://www.hhu.de/"
		>Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf</a
	>. There I wrote my Bachelor's thesis about "Isotope-labelled modeling of the
	Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle" and my masters thesis about "Optimality Principles in Leaf Venation
	Patterns" and finally my PhD about "Computational analysis and optimisation of photosynthetic
	carbon fixation". The keen reader will notice, I like working with plant metabolism and metabolic
	modeling.
